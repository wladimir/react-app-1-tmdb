# Learning React via Bryan Holts' course

Made for learning purposes, currently deployed on [S3 and Cloudfront](https://d2b5vaws6k038t.cloudfront.net).

Uses:

* TMDb API for fetching movie data

* [react-autocomplete](https://github.com/reactjs/react-autocomplete) for autocomplete search box

* [React Boostrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for styling

* Idea and design taken from [this pretty app](https://skempin.github.io/reactjs-tmdb-app/)
